Overview
The Personal Learning Dashboard is a full-featured Flask-based web application that enables users to set, manage, and track their personal educational goals. The app is designed for students, self-learners, and professionals alike who want to stay accountable and organized in their learning journey.

The platform features a secure login and registration system, a dynamic dashboard for adding and updating goals, and visual progress indicators to show how far a user has progressed with their goals. All data is stored using an SQLite database, and the user interface is built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for a clean, responsive experience.

Project Motivation
Throughout CS50x, I found myself constantly setting small goals — whether for finishing problem sets, exploring additional concepts, or scheduling time for practice. I realized how helpful it would be to have a central dashboard for tracking this learning journey. That idea became the foundation of this project: a tool for motivating learning through goal tracking.

I wanted to create something practical, visually appealing, and simple enough for anyone to use — whether they’re coding, studying for exams, or picking up a new skill.
